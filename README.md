👋 Greetings, I'm Mr. Niles Johnson.

💼 Since 2012, I've been working as a Test Automation Engineer in The Netherlands.

🌱 My main focus is using Robot Framework alongside Python. I'm also expanding my skills by learning about Azure, Git, and other programming languages like Powershell. In my free time, I create scripts for my personal projects.

💞️ I'm looking forward to connecting with others who are interested in coding, building pipelines, and Test Automation in general.

📫 Feel free to get in touch if you need assistance with Automation. I'll be glad to help.
