👋 MrNilesJohnson speaking. 

💼 Over the last couple of years i've been working as a 2D animator at a content creation company in The Netherlands.

👀 As a means to broaden my horizon, I now focus on writing scripts and expressions for Adobe After Effects.

🌱 At this moment in time, I'm learning the basics of writing expressions by following a course provided by Motion Design School.

💞️ I'll be lookng forward to connect with likeminded people who are interested in writing expression in After Effects and are conserned with optimize animation workflow. 

📫 Feek free to contact me if you're looking for help with your expressions or if you need some customized code for your project. I'll be happy to help.
